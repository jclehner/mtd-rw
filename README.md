mtd-rw - Write-enabler for MTD partitions
=========================================

Sets the `MTD_WRITEABLE` flag on all MTD partitions that are marked readonly.
When unloading, read-only partitions will be restored. This module is intended
for embedded devices where the mtd partition layout may be hard-coded in the
firmware. If, for some reason, you DO have to write to a read-only partition
(which is often a bad idea), this module is the way to go.

The module is currently limited to the first 64 partitions, but this
should suffice for most purposes.
